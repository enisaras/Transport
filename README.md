  ## Technologies utilized
  Transport is deployed in an Amazon EKS cluster. Each namespace in the cluster represents a step in the data process. Even though
  it is code agnostic, vast majority of the code is written in python, my preffered language for data engineering and science.
  Below is a quick list of each step and what is deployed in each namespace.
  
  ### Step 1: Gathering Data

  ### Step 2: Data preperation and wrangling


  ### Step 3: Analyze and Develop Model

  ### Step 4: Train and Test Model

  ### Step 5: Deploy Model
